This function will take a hard coded question and solution as arguments and allow the user 3 attempts to get the correct answer.
It will determine whether the question is numeric or not so they can be handled differently if needed.
If an incorrect answer is entered it prints a message letting the user know that the answer was incorrect.
If the user gets the correct answer within 3 attempts it prints a message letting the user know that the answer is correct.
